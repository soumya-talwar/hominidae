        <p>Hominidae is a series of interactive autonomous artworks that illustrate sexual violence seen in non-human species of the Great Apes family. Pan is the third and last work in this series, it simulates mathematically the behaviours and battering among a population of 50 chimpanzees.<br><br>
          When a female chimpanzee comes into estrus, the males congregate and compete to mate with her. Unfortunately the males are not just fighting with each other, they're also trying to get at the females. The females have to run to escape clashes with the males, and they try to climb trees but sometimes they’d have their young clinging to them and they’d both fall out of trees. The violence is so great that when a male approaches a female, she doesn't know whether he's coming to mate with her or to be violent toward her. The males have a long history of being violent to the females. It is a way of cowing them so that when they're in estrus and the male approaches them, they don't resist.<br><br>
          Jane Goodall, who observed a group of chimpanzees in Tanzania, recollects: <i>"Nearly 20 years ago, I spent a morning dashing up and down the hills of Gombe, trying to keep up with an energetic young female. On her rear end, she sported this small bright pink swelling, characteristic of the early stages of estrus. For some hours, our run through the park was conducted in quiet--quietly, but then suddenly a chorus of male chimpanzee pant hoots shattered the tranquility of the forest. My female rushed forward to join the males. She greeted each of them, bowing and then turning to present her swelling rear end for inspection. The males examined her kind of perfunctorily and they saw she wasn't really ready yet, and so they resumed grooming one another and showing no interest in this young female.”</i><br><br>
          Goodall then describes how one of the males charged at the female out of the sudden. <i>"The attack came without warning. One of the males charged toward us hair on end, looking twice as large as my small female and enraged. As he rushed by, he picked her up, hurled her to ground, and pummeled her. She cringed and screamed. He ran off, rejoining the other male's seconds later as if nothing had happened."</i> The primatologist saw many assaults like this. These attacks did not end in sexual intercourse—no, their purpose was for the male chimp to establish dominance over the female. They were continual reminders that they're dominant and can coerce them at any minute. So when the female does come into estrus and all the males are around and there's only a very short window of opportunity when he may be alone with her—the other males fighting or not paying attention for a moment—the last thing he wants is for her to resist. She has to be compliant in that very short time, and the purpose of this prior violence is to cow the females into submission at that crucial moment when they need this submission.<br><br>
          The illustration begins with a population of 50 chimpanzees. Then the adult male chimpanzees are sorted into a social hierarchy. This social order among chimpanzees is important because it determines the outcome of the fights between the males to mate with the female who has entered her estrus. If a female enters her estrus, the males will try to seek her and mate with her, while fighting each other at the same time. And if an adult male chimpanzee of a higher rank catches sight of another adult male of a lower rank trying to approach the female, he'll chase him away.<br><br>
          The males in this illustration are painted gray, whereas the females are a light green and their tint changes after each assault by a male chimp. These chimpanzees have a lifespan as well. A chimp grows by a year every 5 seconds, and once it crosses 60 years, it dies.
